Overview
Ramp offers a direct integration with QuickBooks Online, enabling effortless data 
transfer from Ramp to QuickBooks. This ensures your QuickBooks account 
reflects accurate and up-to-date spending details. Our integration respects your 
QuickBooks settings, so no changes are made without your input.
Please note: Once an expense is synced to QuickBooks Online, all future edits 
must be made directly within your accounting software. Syncing an expense will 
lock it in Ramp, preventing any edits.

Transactions 
Ramp syncs transactions to QuickBooks as expenses. Unlike some systems that 
use the banking tab for syncing, Ramp's method ensures valuable data from Ramp 
is utilized, enhancing the efficiency of automation tools. Expenses appear in 
QuickBooks under the 'Expenses' section.
Reimbursements
Reimbursements are sent to QuickBooks as bills, and payments are settled as bill 
payments. This process allows for detailed tracking of reimbursements by vendor 
in QuickBooks.
Additional features

Vendor Creation: Ramp can automatically add new vendors from your 
transactions to QuickBooks (functionality only available to Owner, Admin, and 
Bookkeeper roles. The vendor is not created until after the transaction has 
cleared.) 
Receipt Attachment: Receipts uploaded in Ramp are automatically attached to 
transactions in QuickBooks.
What Ramp looks like
Below is what the QuickBooks Online integration looks like on Ramp after you set it 
up.  We will attempt to find the vendor for you by matching the vendor name on 
Ramp to the vendor names you have on QuickBooks so you donʼt have to. For 
more information on settings, rules, and other automations that Ramp offers, 
please reference this article.

To integrate QuickBooks Online with Ramp:
Step 1 Go to the 'Accounting' tab on your Ramp Dashboard.   
Step 2 Select QuickBooks Online and click 'Connect to QuickBooks'.  
Step 3 Enter your QuickBooks credentials and choose your company.   
Step 4 Back in Ramp, specify default accounts for transactions and 
reimbursements.
Note: The default transaction account must be a Liability and Credit Card type 
in QuickBooks.
What if I need to change accounting providers? 
Suppose you have briefly connected to a different accounting provider and do not 
have any bill payments in flight. In that case, you can disconnect from your current 
accounting provider and follow the setup instructions for your new one. If you 
have bill payments in flight, we strongly recommend you do not disconnect from 
your current accounting provider until outstanding bill payments are paid. 
To disconnect from your current accounting provider:
Go to the Accounting tab and click the Settings button.  
In the Danger zone section, click the Disconnect button. 
If you have bill payments in flight while you change your accounting provider, 
Ramp will try to sync paid bills to the new accounting provider. This means you 
QuickBooks Online o v er vie w

will have trouble matching the bill payment to the original bill because the bill does 
not exist on the new system.
Instead, approve and pay all bills in Ramp before you disconnect the accounting 
provider. After you switch to the new accounting provider, you can enter, approve, 
and pay with bill payments again. The bills you created in your previous 
accounting provider will not sync to the new one. 
How will transactions appear in QuickBooks?
In QuickBooks, transactions appear under 'Expenses'  Expenses. Ramp allows 
detailed coding for each transaction, including categories, vendors, and other 
fields. Transactions can be split across multiple categories, except for Location 
and Vendor.
QuickBooks Online o v er vie w

In QuickBooks, after syncing from Ramp, a fully detailed transaction will display 
various elements. These include Category, Vendor, Location, Customer, Class, 
and a Billable option Yes/No). In addition to these details, the transaction will also 
feature a memo and a receipt, attached at the bottom of the entry. The description 
field in QuickBooks will show the cardholder's first and last name, along with the 
transaction memo.
Moreover, Ramp provides the flexibility to distribute transaction amounts across 
several categories, except for Location and Vendor. This is because while 
Location pertains to the whole transaction, other details like Category and Class 
are relevant to specific parts of the expense in QuickBooks.

Note: we do no support pulling in custom tags from Quickbooks Online. 
How will reimbursements appear in QuickBooks?
Reimbursements are synced as bills and bill payments in QuickBooks, appearing 
under 'Expenses' and 'Vendors'. The vendor for a reimbursement is identified by 
the employee's name and email.
Note: we create a vendor as the merchant for reimbursements. In order to sync 
reimbursements to your QuickBooks account, ensure your QuickBooks version is 
the Quickbooks Online Essentials tier or higher.
The provided image illustrates a completely processed reimbursement via ACH as 
it appears in QuickBooks Online. If you paid a reimbursement via ACH, we will 
sync a bill (marked as paid) and a bill payment.  If you selected Manual Pay within 
Ramp, we will only sync a bill (marked Open).
QuickBooks Online o v er vie w

In this example, notice it is marked as 'Paid' at the top right. In QuickBooks, the 
vendor for this reimbursement is listed as the employee's first and last name, 
followed by their email. Other details included are Category, Location, Customer, 
Class, and whether it's Billable Yes/No).
Additionally, the date listed on the bill corresponds to the approval date. This is 
because the approval date is considered the day when the company officially 
acknowledges the expense.
The corresponding bill payment in QuickBooks also has the same date as the 
approval date. This is because the date of the ACH payment initiation is 
considered the approval date.

Bill Pay
With QuickBooks Online, you have access to our Bill Pay feature. Please reference 
this article for more information.
Statement payments
With QuickBooks Online, you can sync statement payments from Ramp. These 
payments show up in the 'Payments' section of the 'Accounting' tab, but only after 
they are cleared.
For these transactions, you'll get information from two sources: the credit side 
from your Checking Account's bank feed, and the debit side from Ramp. Instead 
of processing these separately, QuickBooks helps you match them to form a 
single transaction. This approach avoids duplicating the same transaction.
For example, let's say there are two statement payments to sync to QuickBooks 
Online in Ramp.
QuickBooks Online o v er vie w

Before syncing, you'll see these transactions on your bank feed for the checking 
account.
After syncing, QuickBooks recognizes that these are part of the same transaction 
and suggests matching them. By confirming this match, the transfer between your 
checking account and Ramp Card account is accurately recorded once.
QuickBooks Online o v er vie w
10
I have already classified the Checking Account payment to the Ramp Card 
account rather than doing a match. What should I do?  
If you've already categorized the checking account payment to the Ramp Card 
account without matching, you can remove the duplicate Ramp Card transaction in 
QuickBooks Online. This prevents recording the same transaction twice.
Treasury: How Ramp syncs transaction objects to 
QuickBooks?
1. Transfer
When itʼs used: Funds move between your linked bank accounts on Ramp and 
your Ramp Business Account, or between 2 of your Ramp Business Accounts (e.g. 
money movement between accounts owned by your business).
Accounting logic:  
Ramp syncs this activity as a Transfer in QBO. No income or expense accounts are 
involved—this reflects an internal movement of funds within your business.
QuickBooks Online o v er vie w
11
2. Deposit
When itʼs used: An external source sends funds into your Ramp business account 
(e.g. Stripe payouts or client payments).
Accounting logic:  
Ramp syncs this activity as a Deposit in QBO. The offsetting account is typically 
an Income, Asset (such as Accounts Receivable), or a custom clearing account, 
depending on your mapping. This ensures incoming funds are accurately 
recorded based on your accounting setup.

3. Expense
When itʼs used: Funds are sent from your Ramp account to an external party (e.g. 
payroll processors or vendor payments).
Accounting logic:  
Ramp syncs this activity as an Expense in QBO. The offsetting account is typically 
an Expense or Liability account, depending on the nature of the transaction (e.g. 
payroll clearing or accounts payable)
QuickBooks Online o v er vie w

4. Earnings payout
Earnings payouts sync as journal entries in your connected ERP. 
The synced deposit will show as a journal entry:
Credit: The account where the funds were withdrawn.  
Debit: The Ramp business account where the funds were deposited.
This ensures your accounting records reflect the movement of funds accurately.

How Ramp syncs statement payments: 
Ramp syncs statement payments as checks in your accounting provider. 
Statement is paid  
   Debit (decrease) Credit Card Liability Account: Reducing the amount you owe 
since you're paying off the credit card.  
   Credit (decrease) Bank Account: This account represents your company's 
cash, which decreases when you pay off the credit card bill.
To reconcile, you must go to your accounting provider to match the amount paid 
to Ramp from your bank account to the total dollar transaction amount synced 
over from Ramp.  If you go to the Transactions tab within Ramp, you can filter by 
the statement period to quickly check which transactions were included in which 
statement.
Cashback redemption
QuickBooks Online o v er vie w
16
The accounting for a cashback is a credit to the Ramp Card account, reducing the 
liability on the card, and a credit to a nominated expense or income account. This 
cashback entry does not appear on a bank feed, so it is important to sync it 
across to the Ramp Card account to bring the value of the liability back into 
balance with the statement.
Ramp Business Account Transfers 
We sync Ramp Business Account wallet transfers as journal entries to QuickBooks 
Online.
