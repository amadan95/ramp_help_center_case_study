booking.

basic economy, economy, or business class with different cancellation policies 
and perks. Review these options carefully to see what's included. The icon next to 
the price indicates policy compliance on the top right. Once you're ready, click 
"Continue to checkout".

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What happens to the approval if the flight/hotel room is no longer 
available¬†before the manager approves?  
  The booking fails, users receive an email asking them to rebook.
I ºm not sure if my booking went through‚Äîwhat should I do?  
  Sometimes confirming a booking can take a little longer than expected. Once it's 
confirmed or failed, we ºll send an update to your work email. If you see a charge 
on your card for the booking amount, that usually means it was successful‚Äîyou 
should receive a confirmation email within 10 minutes.
I didn't receive my confirmation email; how can I get my booking details?  
  You can resend your itinerary by navigating to My Ramp ÓÇò Travel, selecting the 
desired booking to open up the booking details page, and clicking the "Resend 
email" button. Feel free to reach out to Ramp support at any time as well.
Can I make a booking on behalf of a team member?  
  Yes, after the traveler assigns you as their Assistant, you can book and manage 
travel on their behalf. See more details here.
Can I coordinate group trips and make a group booking?  
Booking tra v el on R amp: Emplo y ee guide
12
  As of today, you will not be able to coordinate group trips or book multiple flights 
or rooms in one go, but we expect to support this functionality in 2025.
Why do I not see any Southwest flights available?  
  Currently, we do not support Southwest Airlines' inventory as they tend not to 
partner with online travel agencies for marketing or ticket sales. We are working 
on unlocking this in early 2025.
Can I redeem flights or hotels with points?  
  Whilst users can add in their frequent flyer information to accrue points for flights 
only, they cannot use points to purchase flight or hotel bookings.
How do rewards or loyalty programs function for flights and hotels?  
  ÓÇà For flights, you can enter your Known Traveler Number or membership detail on 
the confirmation page or in your Traveler profile ÓÇÅMy Ramp ÓÇò Travel ÓÇò Traveler 
Profile) while you are booking your flight. If you are not able to add this on Ramp, 
you can also add it on the airline's website directly after you book!¬†¬†  
  ÓÇà For hotels, because we are getting discounted fares for hotels, we cannot 
guarantee rewards will work with hotels. However, many users have had success 
applying rewards or loyalty benefits by calling the hotels directly or applying 
rewards upon hotel check-in.
What is the process for booking multi-city trips?  
  Currently, we do not support multi-city trips. The best way is to book multiple 
one-way flights.
Do negotiated rates with specific hotels appear on Ramp?  
  Our rates are powered by Priceline. Ramp does not offer negotiated rates beyond 
Priceline's standard rates with no booking fee. However, we have an agreement 
with Priceline to help our customers save on travel costs. You should find that total

pricing on Ramp is lower than standard publicly available rates. If you do run into 
cases where the same inventory is cheaper elsewhere, we would be happy to 
investigate.¬†
Can I book a car rental via Ramp?
