and track those payments. The Vendor Portal:

  Lets vendors comment directly with payers on bills  
If you're using this guide, it means one of your customers is using Ramp to 
process accounts payable and send vendor payments.

Optional Vendor Account Creation:
You have the option to create a vendor portal account to manage and track 
your payments, and get access to the additional features described below.

When a company wants to pay you for a service or product, they can select 
you as the vendor on a bill and either:  
   Request payment and tax details from you You will receive an email at the 
address your customer entered in Ramp. Once submitting your details, you'll have 
the option to create a Vendor Portal account and join Ramp's Vendor Network)  
   Manually enter your payment and tax details  
   Connect with you on the vendor network to get your details.  
You will receive an email notification about the incoming payment, from which 
you create a Vendor Portal account to view more details in Ramp.
